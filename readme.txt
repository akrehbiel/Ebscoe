IT service management is closely connected to the process of innovation in a company, which means that the focus is constantly on maximising the input value. 
That is why the profit contribution of changes, the process and solution modelling as well as deadline and budget monitoring during the provision stage played 
a central role in the conceptual development of ebsco.
ebsco supports the entire lifecycle of IT functions, all the way from the decision to launch the provision 
process through change, release and configuration management to the productivity phase and incident and problem management - during operation and right up until
